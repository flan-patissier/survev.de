/**
 * Archives client builds per protocol version so old replays stay watchable.
 *
 * Replays store the raw server->client byte stream, which only the client build of
 * the SAME protocol version can decode (msg layouts + game-type tables shift between
 * versions). This script keeps the last build of each protocol version and publishes
 * them under `dist/archive/<protocolVersion>/`, where nginx serves them statically
 * with no extra config. The moderation dashboard's "Watch" button opens
 * `/archive/<v>/?replay=...` whenever a recording's protocol differs from the
 * current one.
 *
 * Runs automatically as part of `pnpm build` (chained in client/package.json), right
 * after `vite build` - vite wipes `dist/` on every build, so the publish step must be
 * re-applied every time. Can also be run standalone via `pnpm archive` against an
 * existing `dist/`.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   client/dist-archive/<v>/  permanent store (gitignored, survives builds)
 *   client/dist/archive/<v>/  published copy inside the served dist
 *
 * The store is pruned to the newest REPLAY_ARCHIVE_KEEP (default 6) versions —
 * recordings older than the retention window are deleted anyway, so ancient client
 * builds only waste disk.
